Here is the preferred style guide to write report for each description task (grouped by markdown headings) with examples.

## Quantifying countable lesion(s) (`<quantifier>`)

If multiple dimensions for one lesion is provided, use "x" to separate each dimensions.

Examples: "A 5.3x2.5-cm renal cyst" or "A renal cyst, measuring 5.3x2.5 cm"

- Preferred quantifiers: "a few", "several", "many"

- measurement descriptors: 
  - "measuring up to ...", "up to ..."
